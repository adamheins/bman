# bman
`bman` is a tool to browse man pages. I wrote this because I wanted an easy way
to view all of the man pages installed on my system and discover ones I'd never
seen before.

## Usage
After installing `bman`, simply running `bman` will print out a list of all man
pages installed on your system, sorted and origanizes into manual sections.
(Fair warning, you probably have a lot of man pages!)

You can also pass a number to `bman`, corresponding to a manual page section. For example,
```
bman 1
```
only prints out section 1 of the manual.
